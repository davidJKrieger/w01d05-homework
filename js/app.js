// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable ?
    // a. Make up a name for the variable (consider the name carefully because a good name communicates its utility)
    // b. choose how you want to declare your variable (let , const, var) 
        //default to const, use let if you know you will need to reassign it.
        //you should only use var if the rest of the code you are working on uses it. 
    // c. declare the variable by typing its name and setting it equal to its value
    // d. const variable = x

// 2. How do we change the value of a variable ?
    // reasign it using the equals sign.  example: let variable = x ; variable = y

// 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable ?
    // declare a new variable and define it with the name of the existing variable 
    // let newVariable = existingVariable

// 4. Remind me, what are`declare`, `assign`, and`define` ?
    // you declare a variable when you create it. You define the variable when you assign it a value.

// 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it ?
    // pseudocode is code written in english. It is helpful to use while you consider WHAT you want your code to do
    // so you don't get destracted by syntax or how exactly the code should execute.  pseudocoding lets you more easily step through a problem and consider each step the computer will need to follow

// 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
    // Is this a trick question? What are my assumptions? Do I have experience solving similar problems? Do I need to do research? how fast can I type??
    // a beginner should spend most of his time planning and whiteboarding and only typing it in after it is solved on paper.  With some more experiencee,
    // it is helpful to type as you go so you can use console.log and debugger software. even then, more time should be spent planning before you start typing.
